# Limitations
- Apps and Projects have to be added to the groups manually. This cloud be automated by yourself. Or maybe in future we can load all files in a folder as value files.
- There is no App or Project exclusion so be carefull how to scope your groups.
- Currently this chart has to be installed from a git Repo, in future it will be released in a Helm Chart Registry.
